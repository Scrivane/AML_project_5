# AML_project_5

## Instructions to Run the Code

This project is organized into **6 main folders**, each containing different parts of the code.  

### 1. Install Dependencies
The project uses **Poetry** for dependency management. To install Poetry, follow the official guide:  
https://python-poetry.org/docs/  

Once installed, navigate to the project’s root directory and run:

poetry install 

This will install all required dependencies.



To run the code use VS Code with the Jupyter extension.

Open the desired notebook (.ipynb) and either:

Click Run All, or

Run specific sections as needed.

Always make sure you are in the correct directory before running a notebook. For example:
cd ./Cifar_100_Federated
This command moves you into the Cifar_100_Federated directory.



The main code directories are:

Cifar_100_Baseline

Cifar_100_Federated

Shakespeare_Baseline

Shakespeare_Federated

graph  (which contains scripts to generate summary graphs)

/TODO → reserved for personal contributions

Each folder contains:

Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) that can be run, logs of previous runs, which are also used for generating summary graphs and saved last run checkpoints.
