# AML_project_5

Istruction to run the code
the code is split in 6 folders one 
the code uses poetry with a .toml file, to install poetry follow this guide: https://python-poetry.org/docs/ 
after doing so to install dependencies it's enough to write:
poetry install in the parent directory 
To run the code in vscode , use the Jupyter extension and click run all or run only a section of the code

Always move to the directory there there is the code you want to run before doing so
to move into the code directory it's enough to write in the terminal cd ./Cifar_100_Federated to move in the  Cifar_100_Federated  directory.
Directory with code are :
Cifar_100_Baseline
Cifar_100_Federated
Shakespeare_Baseline
Shakespeare_Baseline
/TODO add personal contribution 
All the file .pynb are runnable notebook .
In those directory there are also log of old runs , used also to do the summary graphs .


Also to show the graph the relative code is in the 'graph' directory
